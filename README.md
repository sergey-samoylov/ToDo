# ToDo
ToDo - your cal and ToDo list side by side and day by day. Simple, fast, nice!

On first run ToDo script will ask you to give it a directory, where it will keep all your ToDo's
You can change the script and indicate format for ToDo's. Now it is markdown.

Following KISS principles it should be as simple as possible.

Editing ToDo's in Vim works fine for me now. But maybe I will add "edit" function and "mark as done" right into the script.
